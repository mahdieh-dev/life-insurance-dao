Life Insurance DAO is a DAO on the Ethereum blockchain and is created to make insurance more trustable, easier, and decentralized.

This repository contains the full scripts for creating an `ERC1155 contract`, `ERC20 contract`, and a `Governance contract` (which is needed to let the members of the DAO vote for the proposals).
